# Soft Delete Relational Constraints Implementation Summary

All soft delete relational constraints have now been implemented:

## ðŸ“‹ Soft Delete Relational Constraints Summary

### âœ… Laboratory Deletion

- Check for valid research groups â†’ Prevent deletion
- Check for valid members â†’ Prevent deletion

### âœ… Research Group Deletion

- Check for valid members â†’ Prevent deletion

### âœ… Member Deletion

- Check if member is research group leader â†’ Prevent deletion
- Check for associated valid papers â†’ Prevent deletion

### âœ… Member Batch Deletion

- Check if batch members include research group leaders â†’ Prevent deletion
- Check if batch members have paper associations â†’ Prevent deletion

## ðŸ”— Relational Hierarchy Structure

```bash
Laboratory Lab
â”œâ”€â”€ Research Group ResearchGroup (mem_id â†’ Leader)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Member Member
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Paper Author PaperAuthor â†’ Paper
â””â”€â”€ Member Member (lab_id)
    â””â”€â”€ Paper Author PaperAuthor â†’ Paper
```

This ensures data integrity: users must handle relational dependencies in the order of Papers â†’ Members â†’ Research Groups â†’ Laboratory to successfully delete higher-level records.
